# Santa's Overnight Delivery â€” 2019

Santa's Overnight Delivery is a 2D game that I created with Austin Elliott at Eastern Michigan University. The objective of the game is to stop at as many houses as possible without running into obstacles. The game records data locally on the user's machine to keep track of high scores.

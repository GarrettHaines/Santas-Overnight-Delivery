# santas-overnight-delivery
Santa's Overnight Delivery is a 2D game that I created with Austin Elliott for an algorithms and data structures class at Eastern Michigan University. The objective of the game is to stop at as many houses as possible without running into obstacles. The game records player scores on the user's system.

This program was created in 2019.
